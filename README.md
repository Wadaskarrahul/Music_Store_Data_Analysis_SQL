# Data Analysis of Music Store 

Music store data is used to extract insights and patterns to  improve the store performance, sales and optimize operations.
this data includes attributes such as album, artist, customer, invoice, genre, and employee.

So I performed analysis on this data by questioning the dataset as follows:


Q. who is the senior most emoloyee based on job title?

Q. which countries have the most Invoices?

Q. which city has the best customers? we would like to throw a promotional music festival in the city we made the most money. write a query that returns one city that has the highest sum of invoice totals.
Return both the city name and sum of all invoice totals

Q. who is the best customer? the customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer write a query that returns the person who has spent the most money
